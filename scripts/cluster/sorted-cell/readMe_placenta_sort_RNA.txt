Welcome to /nfs/turbo/bakulski1/People/kyleac/Placenta_Sort_RNA!

genomeReference contains reference genome information from GENCODE, including the GRCh38 primary assembly and v28 of GENCODE's annotation of that genome.
In addition, you will find an assembled, annotated reference genome formatted for STAR mapping, generated using STAR's generate_genome option. That code can be found under
the STAR folder in run2245 analysis code

The four Run22xx folders contain RNA-Seq analysis code and output for the sorted cell types of the placentae.

JC's simple, original example scripts that form the basis of default parameters in the analysis code are also located here.
The scripts found in the analysis code folders are a bit more sophisticated and portable, though careful attention must be paid to directory pathnames.

Salmon-related files used to confirm that RNA-seq experiments were conducted with reverse stranded library prep protocols.
